# Dictionary App

Dictionary App is a user-friendly application created with Reactjs that allows users to search for the meaning of English words and hear their correct pronunciation. This app integrates with a dictionary API to retrieve definitions and audio pronunciation for any word entered in the search field. Users can simply type in a word they want to look up, hit the search button, and the app will display the definition of the word along with an audio clip of the correct pronunciation. With its intuitive interface and reliable API integration, Dictionary App is a handy tool for anyone looking to expand their vocabulary or improve their pronunciation.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Axios, CSS, JavaScript

**Server:** None


## Optimizations

Debouncing is a technique I used in my application to prevent too many requests being made to the API when users are typing in the search field. With debouncing, I added a delay between user input and the API request, so that the API request is only sent once the user has finished typing or after a certain amount of time has passed. This helps to reduce the number of unnecessary requests made to the API, which can improve performance and reduce the load on the server. 

By implementing debouncing, my application can handle a large number of simultaneous users without overwhelming the API, resulting in faster and more reliable performance. This also improves the user experience by reducing the time it takes to get a response from the API and by avoiding the frustration of waiting for the page to load or experiencing errors due to too many requests being made. Overall, debouncing has been a valuable technique for improving the performance and user experience of my application.
